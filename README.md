# AMT_GamificationProject

## Authors: ALBASINI Romain - CIANI Antony - HERNANDEZ Thomas - SELIMI Dardan

## Description
This project is part of the AMT course taught at HEIG-VD by professor Olivier Liechti.

It consists in a gamification platform which potentially can be used by a third-party application to implement basic gamification concepts such as counting points and awarding badges to their users when they perform a certain action or have earned enough points to receive a badge.

The platform relies on a Spring-Boot application acting as an application server which provides a REST API. The setup for the application wanting to use the platform has  to be used via scripting or using the swagger-ui GUI (not really suited for large setups). Data is stored in a MySQL Database.

The whole setup relies on Docker images and on a Docker Compose topology so it can be easily deployed.
